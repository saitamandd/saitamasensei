#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Lecturer, Research Professor, and Head of the AITech Lab (Advanced Intelligence Technologies Lab) at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT). Specializing in cutting-edge AI research, my work spans computer vision, 3D vision, machine learning, speech processing, and real-time intelligent systems.

I lead a dynamic research team. Our team investigates machine vision challenges, NLP-driven solutions, and generative models, with applied projects in autonomous driving, object detection/recognition, speech synthesis, reinforcement learning, and AI-powered chatbots/Q&A systems. Our lab bridges theoretical innovation and industry impact, collaborating with global leaders such as Samsung, Hyundai, AISIN, BK21, ITRC, and TIS to advance solutions in robotics, automotive technology, and intelligent systems.

With a strong focus on multimodal AI integration (vision, speech, and language), our research emphasizes real-world applications, from depth estimation algorithms to scalable speech-processing frameworks. Since founding AITech Lab in 2024 (the core team is my research team ML4U, founded in 2015), we have prioritized fostering partnerships with industry and government to translate academic breakthroughs into deployable technologies.

I remain committed to advancing AI’s frontiers while nurturing the next generation of researchers and engineers. We welcome collaboration opportunities to address complex challenges at the intersection of academia and industry.
